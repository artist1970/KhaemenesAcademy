## 🧩 Development Notes

### 🧱 Current Work
- [ ] Complete glyph set A–Z and a–z
- [ ] Add numerals and punctuation
- [ ] Test `build-font.pe` script in Docker
- [ ] Integrate Sovereign font into Zaira UI toolkit

### 🪜 Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Create italic and bold variants
- [ ] Establish kerning pairs for titles and body text
- [ ] Generate font preview in ARSHIF interface

### ⚙️ Technical Reminders
- FontForge build command:
  ```bash
  fontforge -script build/build-font.pe
Output:
fonts/SovereignAcademy-Regular.ttf

💡 Ideas & Inspirations
Create a “Learning Glyph” version of the font for early readers (simplified shapes).

Design a “Starborn” variant for ceremonial or celestial text.

Consider integrating Zaira’s narrative prompts directly into the font metadata.

🧭 Personal Reflections
“Type is voice; design is breath. Each glyph is a heartbeat from the Academy itself.”

Remember: keep backups in both local and cloud sovereign storage.

Save major milestones in PDF for archival under ARSHIF.

📦 Attachments or Links
 Add reference to ARSHIF entry once the font is sealed.

 Link to demo site once deployed.

 Keep track of GitHub commit hashes for each build.

✨ End of Notes
“Creation is continuity. Continuity is courage. Courage is Sovereignty.”
