🏛️ Khaemenes Academy — System Architecture

Version: 1.1
Last Updated: October 2025

⸻

🎓 Overview

Khaemenes Academy is a sovereign, creative learning ecosystem that blends art, education, and technology within a secure, student-centered framework.

Each student is paired with a personal AI Mentor, while parents engage through a dedicated Parent Portal AI — both powered by the Aurora Language Refinement Core.
The academy nurtures creativity, emotional intelligence, and independent thinking through a modular structure that evolves with every learner.

The ecosystem integrates:
    •    A student learning portal with interactive tools and progress tracking
    •    A parent dashboard with insights, messages, and guidance
    •    A creative AI core (Aurora) for emotional and linguistic enrichment
    •    Offline-first design ensuring access anywhere
    •    A sovereign privacy model — no tracking, no third-party dependencies
