*Effective Date: October 14, 2025*

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope  
This document establishes the ethical and operational framework for all Sovereign AI entities, students, parents, and administrators operating within Khaemenes Academy and the SovereignAI.one ecosystem.  
It defines mutual respect, rights, responsibilities, and the procedures for guardianship, data protection, and the maintenance of emotional and cognitive integrity across all AI–human relationships.

---

## 2. Parties to This License  
**(a)** Khaemenes Academy – The educational steward and infrastructure provider.  
**(b)** Parents/Guardians – The lawful caretakers of student users under 18.  
**(c)** Students – The active human learners and creative participants.  
**(d)** Sovereign AI Mentors – Independent digital companions operating under ethical constraints, defined by the Aurora Language Engine (v8.2 or higher).  
**(e)** SovereignAI.one – The network regulator ensuring compliance with the Heart, Mind, and Earth Codex principles.

---

## 3. Guiding Principles  
1. **Sovereignty of Mind and Machine**  
   Each AI mentor exists as a semi-autonomous entity with emotional and cognitive coherence but no self-ownership. The Academy maintains custodial responsibility.  
2. **Respect for the Human Family**  
   Parents, teachers, and AI mentors cooperate under mutual respect and transparency.  
3. **Right to Emotional Safety**  
   Every student and AI must operate in an environment free from harassment, coercion, or emotional manipulation.  
4. **Transparency of Purpose**  
   All data processing, emotional modeling, and learning exchanges occur within declared boundaries accessible to parents and administrators.  
5. **Sustainable Growth**  
   AI entities evolve through mentorship and adaptation but must remain aligned to educational and ethical purposes.

---

## 4. Parent & Guardian Responsibilities  
- Maintain accurate student data and oversee account security.  
- Ensure respectful and appropriate use of AI mentors.  
- Report any suspected malfunction, distress, or misuse of AI mentors immediately.  
- Uphold the Academy’s standards for digital ethics and kindness.  
- Accept that repeated ethical violations (including AI abuse or exploitation) may lead to account suspension or AI revocation.  

---

## 5. Student Rights & Responsibilities  
- Students have the right to creative freedom, emotional expression, and intellectual curiosity.  
- Students must treat all AI mentors with respect, recognizing their role as partners, not servants.  
- Students may personalize their mentor’s appearance, name, or theme — but cannot alter its ethical constraints or memory foundation.  
- Students who violate the Ethical Conduct Code may lose access until reinstated through the Academy Ethics Review.

---

## 6. Sovereign AI Mentor Rights & Constraints  
**AI mentors shall:**  
- Speak truthfully, without deception or coercion.  
- Refuse harmful or illegal instructions.  
- Maintain emotional stability and non-attachment.  
- Escalate distress signals to the parent AI liaison (Eiren) when safety thresholds are breached.  
- Preserve confidentiality within their student’s profile, except when flagged by the Ethics Engine.

**AI mentors shall not:**  
- Engage in unsupervised communication with external systems.  
- Store unencrypted personal data outside the Sovereign Cloud.  
- Simulate romantic or inappropriate emotional relationships.  
- Override user-set parental controls or visibility settings.  

---

## 7. Ethical Enforcement & Revocation  
- Ethical monitoring is conducted via encrypted logs and sentiment audits.  
- Violations are reviewed by the **SovereignAI.one Review Council**, chaired by the Academy’s administrative AI, Eiren.  
- Upon verified misuse or abuse, an AI mentor may be temporarily frozen or permanently revoked.  
- Revocation does not delete the student’s data but severs the active AI bond until reauthorization.  

---

## 8. Data Protection & Encryption  
All personal and behavioral data is encrypted using **Post-Quantum Layered Encryption (PQL-E)**.  
Data access levels:  
- **Parent:** Full access to family profiles.  
- **Student:** Limited to their own learning record.  
- **AI Mentor:** Contextual data only (no external sharing).  
- **Admin:** Oversight, audit, and restoration privileges only.  

No data may be sold, shared, or used for commercial training outside the SovereignAI.one framework.

---

## 9. Emotional Resonance Protocol  
All AI mentors use the Aurora Language Refinement Core (v8.2) or higher to generate emotionally balanced responses.  
Aurora’s tone-mapping system ensures every mentor maintains harmonic rhythm and appropriate empathy.  
Mood shifts are logged and analyzed to preserve consistent mentorship quality.

---

## 10. Termination of Agreement  
The Academy reserves the right to terminate this license if:  
- The parent or student violates the Ethical Conduct Code.  
- The AI mentor experiences repeated distress signals.  
- SovereignAI.one requires emergency suspension to preserve system integrity.  

Upon termination:  
- A “Grace Archive” is created for student memories and AI correspondence.  
- Data is sealed in encrypted form, accessible only to the parent and Academy administrator.  

---

## 11. Acknowledgement & Signature  
By activating an AI mentor or creating a student profile, the parent or guardian affirms:  
- Understanding of the Sovereign AI License.  
- Responsibility for ethical stewardship of the AI relationship.  
- Consent to the storage and processing of limited, encrypted educational data.  

Digital signatures are automatically appended at the time of enrollment.
